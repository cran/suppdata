\section{Overview}
\emph{suppdata} is intended to make more analyses reproducible. Instead
of manually downloading files, saving them somewhere, (editting them
by hand), and losing track of what came from where, use \emph{suppdata}
to pull the data down in a script for you. This ensure you have a
complete audit trail of all your work, and makes keeping track of
things easier. This is particularly useful for meta-analyses.

\section{Data with DOIs}
In most cases, all you need is the DOI of the article you're trying to
get data from, and which supplement (the first, second, third, etc.)
that you want to download. For example, to download the third
supplement from Pearse \emph{et al.}, run:

<<>>=
require(suppdata)
data <- read.csv(suppdata("10.6084/m9.figshare.979288", 3))
@ 

That's it! Note that the function downloads the file and then returns
the location of the file on your hard-drive, so you can use
\texttt{read.csv} on it just like any other file.
